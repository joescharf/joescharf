# Joe Scharf

I'm a [Fractional CTO](https://fcto.io) advising startups and PE-backed companies on business strategy and technical operations. I help engineering organizations adopt AI development tools safely and effectively. I've been building with AI coding agents for over a year now, and with the 2026 launch of Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.2, we've hit an inflection point. These tools are no longer optional for developers, product managers, or engineering leaders. I'm building tools and full applications in hours or days that used to take months, and I train teams to do the same.

## What I'm Building

**[wt](https://github.com/joescharf/wt)**: Git worktree manager for parallel AI development. Creates isolated worktrees with dedicated Claude Code sessions, handles sync, merge, and cleanup. I run 3-4 agent sessions simultaneously on the same repo with this.

**[gsi](https://github.com/joescharf/gsi)**: Go project scaffolder that sets up new projects with standardized libraries, documentation, CI/CD, and an optional web UI. When the AI starts a session in a gsi-scaffolded project, it already knows the structure and dependencies. No tokens wasted figuring things out.

**[rag-tutorial](https://github.com/joescharf/rag-tutorial)**: A from-scratch RAG tutorial in Python. Jupyter notebook that builds up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline piece by piece, plus a reusable CLI and library. I built this for a team I was training on AI development tools.

**[FDSN Portal](https://github.com/joescharf/fdsn)**: Full-stack Go + React application for seismic station metadata management. Single binary with an embedded React UI, SQLite database, interactive maps, and waveform visualization. This is what AI-assisted development produces at speed.

**[DBSnapper](https://dbsnapper.com)**: Database snapshot and sanitization tool. Automates snapshotting and de-identification for development and testing environments.

## Background

25+ years building and scaling engineering teams at SaaS startups. First employee and VP of Engineering at SendGrid (zero to $65M ARR). Helped run the first two Techstars Boulder classes and ongoing mentor. Started my career writing embedded C and C++ for satellite missions and telecom SONET multiplexers.
