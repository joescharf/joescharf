## Background
Over 20 years leading software and product for cloud startups (ex. VPE @ SendGrid, VPProd @ Automox, Techstars).

Active full-stack and founding engineer roles, I have built SaaS systems from the first-line-of-code that now support hundreds of thousands of transactions per year.

In my earlier career I was an embedded software engineer in the Aerospace and Telecommunications industries, developing in C and C++ on VxWorks and Embedded Linux (Buildroot) operating systems
